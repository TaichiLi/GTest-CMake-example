# GTest-CMake-example

An example about building a GTest project using CMake.

## Introduction

This `GTest` project is a demo that uses `CMake` to build, and supports `GCC` and `Clang`.

I want to practice `CMake` with this project, so it may have many defects or even errors. Of course, This project has met my basic requirements.

```

## Environment

- Clang 9.0.0 (Not tested on other versions)
- MinGW-w64 8.1.0 (Not tested on other versions)
- GTest 1.7.0 and 1.10.0

## Build

I've customized three options to select `complier`, `GTest sersion`, `64bits or 32bits`.

| Option Name  | Value  |
|    ----      | ----   |
| `COMPILER`   |   `clang` `gcc`|
| `GTEST_VERSION`   |   `1.7.0` `1.10.0`|
| `GTEST_BITS`   |   `x64` `x86`|

You can use `-D<OPTION_NAME>="Value"` to specify them. The value for options is **case insensitive**.

**Note:** 
1. I don't compile this project by other compiler.
2. `Clang` only supports `x64`.

### MinGW Makefiles

In project root (folder `CMakeList.txt` is in):

```
mkdir build
cd build
```

then run `CMake` to generate `MinGW Makefiles` ..

```
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  -DGTEST_VERSION="1.7.0" -DGTEST_BITS="x64" -DCOMPILER="clang" ..
```

finally just build project

```
mingw32-make
```

## Notes

1. If you want to change the compilation options, first clear the files generated by the last `CMake` run (or only clear `CMakeCache.txt` ). 
2. If your compiler's exception handling model isn't `sjlj`, you should change clang's compile option `-fsjlj-excetions`,
    - `seh` to use `-fseh-excetions`
    - `dwarf` to use `-fdwarf-excetions`
3. The older binary releases of MinGW-w64 have an incompatibility with Clang 8.0+'s float.h. To fix this, copy [this specific revision of float.h](https://github.com/mirror/mingw-w64/raw/82b169c5734a6198d3b4c51a48f82e7b7104f143/mingw-w64-headers/crt/float.h) into the correct location and use it.
